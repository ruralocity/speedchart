# Thanks for your interest in this project!

I'm using this as a project to improve my knowledge of the Python ecosystem.
As such, I'm not taking pull requests right now, but do welcome suggestions.
If you see something that doesn't work as advertised in the README, or
something I could do better, please create an issue so we can discuss it, and
I can learn.

Once I've wrapped up my learning, I'll be happy to accept pull requests, and
will provide more information here when that time comes.

Thanks!
